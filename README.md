# Application for managing the events of a ballroom
### This is a project in which I tried to make a client-server application for managing the events of a ballroom.
### The client side is formed from an admin form and a client form, only the client form being functional, meaning that there is space for improvement and adding new functionalities. It is mainly composed of HTML, JavaScript and PHP implementations.
### The server side is composed of a relational database made of 7 tables using MySQL.
#### Language used for comments and code: romanian.
